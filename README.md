This is an Anki deck for learning the rules for Pathfinder, 2nd ed. 

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a spaced-repetition flashcard system which is an excellent way to efficiently memorize large amounts of information.

This deck can be imported into Anki using the [CrowdAnki plugin](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki).

The cards were created somewhat haphazardly by me as I first read the rulebook.  They have lots of typos and speech recogition errors.  They could definitely use tags to make it easier to select what to include and what not to include.  Contributions via pull requests are very welcome.
